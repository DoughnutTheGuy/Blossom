## DIY Guide

1. In `case_stls`, you can either use 3d print or other method to print out the upper and lower case
2. using a soldering iron or hot glue to insert 8 [M2.5 inserts](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Threaded-Insert-Embedded-Knurled/dp/B01N3N5J2F) to the corrisponding positions.
3. Using the dxf files in the `plate_dxfs`, make the palte and the gasket with the material of your choice.
4. Stick the gastket strips from `plate_pcb_layer.dxf` to the plate.
5. Create a pcb from [FateNozomi](https://github.com/FateNozomi/arisu-pcb) and solder everything. Remember to place the dampening layer between pcb and plate.
6. Screw two halfs of the case together using a [socket headed M2.5 screw](https://www.amazon.com/50-M2-5-0-45-5mm-Stainless-MonsterBolts/dp/B078KZZKPC).
