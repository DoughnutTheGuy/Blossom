## DIY Guide

1. In `case_stls`, you can either use 3d print or other method to print out the upper and lower case
   - Newest Version of [top case](https://github.com/DoughnutTheGuy/Blossom/blob/main/case_stls/new_top-Top_Case_with_hole_thing.stl)
   - Newest Version of [bottom case](https://github.com/DoughnutTheGuy/Blossom/blob/main/case_stls/new_top-Bottom_Case.stl)
3. using a sodering iron or hot glue to insert 8 [M2.5 inserts](https://www.amazon.com/uxcell-Threaded-Insert-Embedded-Knurled/dp/B01N3N5J2F) to the corrisponding positions.
4. Using the .dxf files in the `plate_dxfs`, make the palte and the gasket with the material of your choice.
   - Newest Version of [plate](https://github.com/DoughnutTheGuy/Blossom/blob/main/plate_dxfs/plate.dxf)
   - Newest Version of [gasket & sound dampening layer between pcb and plate](https://github.com/DoughnutTheGuy/Blossom/blob/main/plate_dxfs/plate_pcb_layer.dxf)
7. Create a pcb from [FateNozomi](https://github.com/FateNozomi/arisu-pcb) and solder everything. Remember to place the dampening layer between pcb and plate.
8. Screw two halfs of the case together using a [socket headed M2.5 screw](https://www.amazon.com/50-M2-5-0-45-5mm-Stainless-MonsterBolts/dp/B078KZZKPC).
